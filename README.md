# glide_demo_ui

> Glide demo ui

## Considerations

- The project was scaffolded using [NuxtJs](https://nuxtjs.org).
- Since I haven't worked with UI lately I've chose Vue just for fun and to try something that it's said to be better than Angular.
- Even when this project is too big for the task, starting from the ground would have been cumbersome and would ended up with a clumsy project unable to grow properly.

## Build Setup & Run

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

__Warning__: you need the api server running in the same host.

## TODO

- Localization
- Error handling
- Server side pagination
- Style
- Security
- Dev/Test/Prod configuration
- ...
